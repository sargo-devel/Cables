# Data structure:

# Name, Element Type, Connector Class, geometric data...

# All measures must be in millimeters

# Possible element types are:

# ExtShape =  Details of a Connector shape
# Terminal =  Details of a single terminal
# SupportLines = Details of a single Support Lines shape

# Additional preset types must be implemented in archCableConnector.py first

# Proposed naming convention for Connector Class:
# for Connector Element Type: repeated class from connectorpresets.csv
# for Terminal and SupportLines Types: Terminal or SupportLines accordingly
