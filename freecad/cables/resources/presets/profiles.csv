# Data structure:

# Name, Profile class, Voltage Class, geometric data...

# All measures must be in millimeters

# Possible profile classes are:

# R=  Round cable
# F=  Flat cable
# PRESET= Not a profile but preset with additional data. Preset has to contain existing
#         Name and VoltageClass defined in one of profiles.

# Additional profile types must be implemented in cableProfile.py first
