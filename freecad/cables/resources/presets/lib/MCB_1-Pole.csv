# Data structure:

# Name, ElementType, DeviceClass, geometric data...

# All measures must be in millimeters

# Possible element types are:

# ExtShape =  Details of a Device shape
# Terminal =  Details of a single terminal
# SupportLines = Details of a single Support Lines shape

# Additional element types must be implemented in archElectricalDevice.py first

# Proposed naming convention for DeviceClass:
# for ExtShape Element Type: repeated class from devicepresets.csv
# for Terminal and SupportLines Types: Terminal or SupportLines accordingly
