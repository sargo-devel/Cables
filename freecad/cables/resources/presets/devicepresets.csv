# Data structure:

# Name, PresetType, DeviceClass, geometric data...

# All measures must be in millimeters

# Possible preset types are:

# Fixed =  Fixed shape loaded from STEP file "StepFileName" in library.
#          Additionally the file "DeviceClass_Name.csv" from library is loaded.
#          Example: "Dummy_Dummy.step" and "Device_Dummy.csv" are loaded from library if
#                   DeviceClass="Device",
#                   Name="Dummy",
#                   StepFileName="Dummy_Dummy.step" are set

# Additional preset types must be implemented in archElectricalDevice.py first

# Proposed naming convention for DeviceClass:
# Company name or widely used common name for group of devices
